Very good article to understand ERC721 , https://medium.com/blockchannel/walking-through-the-erc721-full-implementation-72ad72735f3c

To me, token standards can be summarized and compared in the following ways:
Ownership — How is token ownership handled?
Creation — How are tokens created?
Transfer & Allowance — How are tokens transferred, and how do we allow other addresses (contracts or externally owned accounts) transfer capability?
Burn — How do we burn or destroy a token?
